I can never remember how to best orient flexbox to do what I want. I have notes trapped inside
note-taking apps, text files, or whatever, and always hitting those. What if, magically, the intertÅ«bes
allowed me to publish information so it could be reused by me, and even others?!?1111!!!

So I did this thing. Here it is. This is primarily my own note repository, but if you find it useful, please
drop me a note, star it, leave a fake issue, even. Just so I know you're there, and my code doesn't get
lonely.

You can find the examples in a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) build here: https://newtmitch.github.io/react-flexbox-examples/

Oh, and I bootstrapped these examples with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Because it's awesome.
